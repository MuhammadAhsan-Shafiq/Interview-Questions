**iOS and Python Interview Questions**

A curated collection of Swift and Python interview questions!

This repository contains real interview questions I encountered during my iOS development journey, along with frequently asked topics. It focuses purely on programming fundamentals, OOP, data structures, algorithms, and core concepts ‚Äî no UI-related questions are included.

**üìÅ Repository Structure** 

/Python
    - Problem1.py
    - Problem2.py
    - ...

/Swift
